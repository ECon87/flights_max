# Number of flights on the air
This repo is my version of the solution to the problem in "Keep on Coding"'s video about the question he got in his facebook interview:

> Given a list of flight times. What's is the maximum number of flights on the air at the same time?


## Notes
I include the end-time as still in the air.
This is unlike the question in the video. But this can easily changed by changing the weak inequality to a strict one.
